# 🚀 Automate Material Data Extraction from Revit Models – No Coding Required  

Easily export all **Material Quantities** along with **Level, Category, Family, and Type** into an Excel file in seconds, ensuring **accurate and up-to-date project data**.  

This automation **eliminates manual effort**, **reduces errors**, and provides a **structured format** for further analysis.  

Seamlessly integrate the exported data with **reporting tools** or **dashboards** to enhance project tracking and decision-making.

## 📏 Group and Quantify  

Organize material data efficiently by grouping by:  
🔸 **Level**  
🔸 **Category**  
🔸 **Type**  
🔸 **Material Name**  

Automatically generate **comprehensive summaries** including:  
✅ **Area**  
✅ **Volume**  
✅ **Density**  

This ensures **accurate tracking of material usage** across projects, allowing for **better cost estimation and resource planning**.

## 🎯 Select Categories  

You don't need to export everything—**select specific Categories** to export.  

Use the **exact names** of the **Categories** you want to extract materials from, separating them with a **comma**.  

---

## ➕ Add Parameters  

You can add **additional parameters** to export along with **Material Quantities, Level, Category, Family, and Type**.  

Use the **exact names** of the **Parameters** you want to extract.  
For nested parameters, use **dot (.) notation** to separate properties. (ie. properties.elementId)
For multiple properties, **separate them with a comma**.

### 📌 Example: **Category and Parameters**
